# Companion Module for Ableton Live (OSC)

This module allows you to control Ableton Live via OSC using the [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) control script.

It offers advanced visual feedback, including clip names, colors, and real-time audio meters directly on your Stream Deck buttons.

## Prerequisites

- **Ableton Live** (Version 11 or 12)
- **Bitfocus Companion**
- The **AbletonOSC** script installed in Ableton Live.

## Installing AbletonOSC

For this module to work, you must install the remote script in Ableton Live:

1. Download the latest version of [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) (Code > Download ZIP).
2. Extract the `AbletonOSC-master` folder.
3. Rename the extracted folder to `AbletonOSC`.
4. Install it following the instructions on Ableton's Installing third-party remote scripts doc, by copying the AbletonOSC folder to:

    Windows: \Users\[username]\Documents\Ableton\User Library\Remote Scripts  
    macOS: Macintosh HD/Users/[username]/Music/Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts

5. Restart Ableton
6. In **Preferences** > **Link / Tempo / MIDI**, under the Control Surface dropdown, select the new "AbletonOSC" option. Live should display a message saying "AbletonOSC: Listening for OSC on port 11000"
7. Verify that the default ports are 11000 (Input) and 11001 (Output). If you change them, note them down for Companion configuration.

## Configuration in Companion

1.  Add an **Ableton Live (OSC)** instance in Companion.
2.  Configure the settings:
    *   **Target IP**: The IP address of the computer running Ableton (leave `127.0.0.1` if it's the same computer).
    *   **Target Port (Send)**: AbletonOSC listening port (Default: `11000`).
    *   **Receive Port (Listen)**: Companion listening port for feedback (Default: `11001`).
3.  Save. The status should change to "OK".

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: First Step

**Before using any buttons, you MUST run the "Scan Project" action.**

1.  Go to the **Presets** tab.
2.  Open the **Utility** category.
3.  Drag the **Scan Project** button (Yellow background) to your surface.
4.  Press the button.

This will fetch the number of tracks, scenes, clip names, and colors from your current Ableton project. Without this step, buttons may not work or display correct information.

## Presets Inventory

The module automatically generates presets to help you get started quickly.

### Category: Utility

*   **Display the clip name** as the button name.
*   **Display the clip color** as the button background.
*   **Blink** when the clip is playing.

### Category: Tracks
Buttons to control tracks:
*   **Mute Track**: Toggles track mute.
    *   Displays track name.
    *   **Red Background** when muted.
    *   **Visual Meter** (Right bar) showing real-time audio level.

### Category: Tracks Stop
*   **Stop Track**: Stops playing all clips on a specific track. Displays the track name.

*   **Clip Playing (Blink)**: Blinks the button when the clip is playing.
*   **Track Meter Level**: Changes color if audio level exceeds a threshold.
*   **Track Mute**: Changes background color (Red) if track is muted.
*   **Track Meter Visual**: Displays a real-time PNG bargraph on the button (Stereo Left, Stereo Right, or Full).

## Variables

*   `$(ableton:clip_name_TRACK_CLIP)`: Clip name (e.g., `$(ableton:clip_name_1_1)`).
*   `$(ableton:track_name_TRACK)`: Track name.
*   `$(ableton:track_meter_TRACK)`: Current track audio level (0.0 to 1.0).
*   `$(ableton:track_mute_TRACK)`: Track mute state (1 or 0).

## Troubleshooting

*   **No visual feedback (Meters/Names)?**
    *   Did you run **Scan Project**?
    *   Check that the "Receive Port" in Companion matches the output port configured in AbletonOSC (usually 11001).
    *   Check that no firewall is blocking UDP ports 11000 and 11001.
*   **Module disconnects/reconnects?**
    *   Check Companion logs. If it persists, check your network configuration.
